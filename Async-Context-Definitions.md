
# Async Context Definitions

## 1. Overview

Node.js uses an event-driven non-blocking I/O model of execution instead of 
multi-threading. This model simplifies reasoning about many aspects of 
program execution but requires the use of _callback_ or _promise_ based code 
to ensure applications remain responsive. Thus, understanding the behavior of 
an application requires understanding the execution of several blocks of code 
and how their executions' are related via asynchronous callback interleavings 
and execution dependencies.

This document provides a specification for asynchronous execution in Node.js 
and a model for reasoning about the relationships between asynchronous calls 
in an application. Colloquially, such relationships are called 
**Asynchronous Context**. A formal definition of Asynchronous Context is given 
in section 2. We model state transitions in asynchronous context as a series 
of discrete events that occur during program execution. These events are 
described in detail in section 3. The event streams can be used to build a 
directed acyclic graph, that we call the **Asynchronous Call Graph**. How the 
events are used to construct the Asynchronous Call Graph is defined in 
section 4. Section 5 gives a number of example problems that are easily 
reasoned about given the terminology defined herein. Lastly, section 6 shows a 
number of common asynchronous code patterns in Node.js, and shows the event 
stream produced from such code executing, as well as some examples of 
the resulting Asynchronous Call Graphs.

## 2. Definition of an Asynchronous API
A fundamental challenge for asynchronous execution tracking is that, in the 
Node.js model, asynchronous behavior is defined both at different layers 
of the code stack and through implicit API usage conventions. Thus, our 
definitions and mechanisms for tracking asynchronous execution rely on:
 1. A convention based notion of `client` code which sees 
 _asynchronous execution_ based on a sequence of executed JavaScript functions 
 from logical asynchronous contexts.
 2. A convention based notion of `host` code, which can be native C++, 
 JavaScript in Node core, or even other userland code that surfaces an 
 asynchronous API to the `client` -- even if the underlying implementations 
 mixes the execution of code from different logical asynchronous client 
 contexts in a single synchronous execution.
 3. A set of explicit tagging API's that will notify us of which API's are 
 involved in these boundaries, the contexts they are associated with, and 
 which relations they affect.

These issues are illustrated by the Node `timers` API which, as described 
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/), 
is implemented using JavaScript in Node core and uses a list of timer 
callbacks to track _every_ function to be executed when a given timespan has 
elapsed. When the timespan expires a single synchronous function is called 
from the LibUV library, `listOnTimeout`, that iterates over the list and 
executes every function. Thus, from a runtime viewpoint all of the functions 
are part of the same asynchronous context regardless of which (logically 
different) client asynchronous contexts added them. 

### Definition of Context and Ordering
A single JavaScript function may be passed to multiple asynchronous API's 
and, in order to track the state of each of these asynchronous executions 
independently, we must be able to distinguish between uses of the same 
function from multiple logically different asynchronous executions. Thus, 
we begin by defining an _asynchronous function context_ (or context) as a 
unique identifier. We only require that fresh instances of these 
values can be generated on demand and compared for equality. In practice 
monotonically increasing integer values provide a suitable representation.
For a given function _f_ we define the asynchronous context representation 
of _f_ in context _i_ as _f<sub>i</sub>_. 

Our definitions of asynchronous executions are based on four 
binary relations over the executions of logically asynchronous JavaScript 
functions:
 - **execution** -- when a function _f_ is executed we create a unique 
 fresh context for it _c_ and use this as the `execution` context for 
 asynchronous events that happen during the execution of _f_.
 - **link** -- when the execution of function _f_ in context _i_ stores a 
 second function _g_ in context _j_ for later asynchronous execution we say 
 _f<sub>i</sub>_ `links` _g<sub>j</sub>_. 
 - **causal** -- when the execution of a function _f_ in context _i_ is 
 logically responsible (according to the `host` API) 
 for causing the execution of a previously **linked** _g_ from context _j_ 
 we say _f<sub>i</sub>_ `causes` _g<sub>j</sub>_. 
 - **happens before** -- when a function _f_ with execution context _i_ 
 is asynchronously executed before a second function _g_ with execution 
 context _j_ then _i_ < _j_ and we say _f<sub>i</sub>_ `happens before` 
 _g<sub>j</sub>_.

We define the following module code that provides the required functions to
explicitly mark API's that expose asynchronous behavior from `host` code to 
`client` code and which enable the tracking of the core asynchronous execution 
concepts.
```js
let globalCtxCtr = 0;
function generateNextContextID() {
  return ++globalCtxCtr;
}

let globalTimeCtr = 0;
function generateNextTime() {
  return ++globalTimeCtr;
}

// initialize to "root context" of 0
let currentExecutingContext = 0;

function emit(obj) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj));
}

function link(f) {
  const linkID = generateNextContextID();
  emit({event: "link", executeID: currentExecutingContext, linkID});

  return { function: f, linkID };
}

function cause(ctxf) {
  const causeID = generateNextContextID();
  emit({event: "cause", executeID: currentExecutingContext, linkID: ctxf.linkID, causeID });

  return Object.assign(ctxf, { causeID });
}

function execute(ctxf) {
  const origCtx = currentExecutingContext;
  currentExecutingContext = generateNextContextID();

  emit({event: "executeBegin", executeID: currentExecutingContext, causeID: ctxf.causeID});

  let res = undefined;
  try {
    res = ctxf.function.call(null);
  }
  finally {
    emit({event: "executeEnd", executeID: currentExecutingContext});
    currentExecutingContext = origCtx;
  }

  return res;
}
```
Using this code a `host` will provide an asynchronous API abstraction by 
`contextifying` the functions passed to API's that it wishes to pool for later 
asynchronous execution. At each later phase the `link`, `cause`, and `execute` 
functions will need to be invoked to drive the asynchronous execution and 
update/write the appropriate context information.

## 3. Well Formed Asynchronous Event Trace
An event trace for an asynchronous execution must satisfy the following 
ordering and identify requirements:
 1) For any context the events must be ordered in the form: link < cause 
 < beginExecute < endExecute
 2) A single link context, cause context, or execute context may only be 
 introduced in a single event.
 3) A link context may appear in multiple `cause` and `execute` events.
 4) a cause context may appear in multiple `execute` events.
 
The emit events must also satisfy the grammar constraints of the language:
```
Trace := Execution* PartialExecution?

Execution := beginExecution AsyncOp* endExecution

PartialExecution := beginExecution AsyncOp*

AsyncOp := link | cause
```

**TODO:** I would like to make this stronger as any invariants here help 
users of this output as well as provide acceptance criteria for an 
implementation.

## Asynchronous Annotations Examples
To illustrate how the asynchronous annotation code can be used to convert a 
`host` API into one that tracks asynchronous events for client code we look 
at applying them to a sample of a callback based API as well as 
the promise API.

### Callback API
For this example we start with a simple asynchronous API that defines 
two method for registering callbacks:
```js
let worklist = [];
setInterval(() => {
  const wl = worklist;
  worklist = [];
  wl.forEach((entry) => {
    execute(entry.task);
    if(entry.isRepeat) {
      worklist.push(entry);
    }
  });
}, 500);

//Invoke the callback ONCE asynchronously on later turn of event loop
function callbackOnce(f) {
  const cf = cause(link(f));
  worklist.push({task: cf, isRepeat: false});
}

//Invoke the callback REPEATEDLY asynchronously on later turns of event loop
function callbackRepeating(f) {
  const cf = cause(link(f));
  worklist.push({task: cf, isRepeat: true});
}
```
This example shows how the use of the core asynchronous module code delineates 
the points at which logical linking and causal context are captured or 
propagated. If we invoke this API as follows (when the currentContext is 0):
```js
callbackRepeating(() => console.log("// Hello Repeating"));

let doit = true;
callbackOnce(() => {
  console.log("// Hello Once") 
  if(doit) {
    doit = false;
    callbackOnce(() => console.log("// Did it"));
  }
});
```
We will see the asynchronous trace:
```json
{"event":"link","executeID":0,"linkID":1}
{"event":"cause","executeID":0,"linkID":1,"causeID":2}
{"event":"link","executeID":0,"linkID":3}
{"event":"cause","executeID":0,"linkID":3,"causeID":4}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":5,"causeID":2}
// Hello Repeating
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":5}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":6,"causeID":4}
// Hello Once
{"event":"link","executeID":6,"linkID":7}
{"event":"cause","executeID":6,"linkID":7,"causeID":8}
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":6}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":9,"causeID":2}
// Hello Repeating
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":9}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":10,"causeID":8}
// Did it
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":10}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":11,"causeID":2}
// Hello Repeating
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":11}
{"event":"executeBegin","executeID":12,"causeID":2}
// Hello Repeating
{"event":"executeEnd","executeID":12}
  ...
```

See a visualization of the above event stream [here](./markdown-example-1/slideShow/async-context.html);

### Promise API
Similarly we can provide a basic promise API that supports asynchronous 
context tracking by modifying the real promise implementation as follows: 
**TODO** this is super rough.

```js
function then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    cfFulfilled = contextify(onFulfilled);
    link(cfFulfilled);

    cfRejected = contextify(onRejected);
    link(cfRejected);

    if(this.isResolved) {
      if(this.success) {
        cause(cfFulfilled);
      }
      else {
        cause(cfRejected);
      }
    }

  ...
}

function resolve(value) {
  this.handlers.forEach((handler) => cause(cfFulfilled));
  ...
}

function reject(value) {
  this.handlers.forEach((handler) => cause(cfFulfilled));
  ...
}
```
If we invoke this API as follows (when the currentContext is 0):
```js
const p = new Promise((res) => {
  console.log("Promise p");
  callbackOnce(() => {
    console.log("Promise resolve");
    res(42);
  });
});

console.log("Promise then");
p.then((val) => {
  console.log(`Hello ${val} World!`);
});
```
We will see the asynchronous trace:
```json
  {"event": "executeBegin", "executeID": "0" }
  //Prints "Promise P"
  {"event": "link", "executeID":0,"linkID":1}
  {"event": "cause", "executeID":0, "linkID": 1, "causeID": 2}
  //Prints "Promise then"
  {"event": "link",  "executeID":0, "linkID": 3}
  {"event": "executeEnd", "executeID": "0" }
  {"event":"executeBegin","executeID":4,"causeID":2}
  //Prints "Promise resolve"
  {"event": "cause", "executeID": 4, "linkID": 3, "causeID": 5}
  {"event": "executeEnd", "executeID": 4}
  {"event": "executeBegin", "executeID": 6, "causeID": 5}
  //Prints "Hello 42 World!"
  {"event": "executeEnd", "executeID": 6}
```

See a visualization of the above event stream [here](./markdown-example-2/slideShow/async-context.html); 

These two examples show how the the context relations from 
[DLS17](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NodeAsyncContext.pdf) 
can be lifted into the Node ecosystem without the use of the _priority promise_ 
construct (although at the loss of unified scheduling and priority).

## 4. Asynchronous Call Graph
The events described above can be used to construct and maintain an
`Asynchronous Call Graph`, which is a directed acyclic graph.

Nodes are defined as follows:
  * An "execution context" node is defined when an "executeBegin" event 
  is received and all linking/causal events will create child edges from 
  this node until the matching "executeEnd" event is seen.

  * A "linking context" node is defined when a "link" event is received and 
  is associated with the data from the link event.

  * A "causal context" node is defined when a "cause" event is received and 
  is associated with the data from the cause event.

Edges are defined as follows: 
  * A "link" edge is added from the current "execution context" node 
  to a newly created "linking context" node when a "link" event is 
  received. 

  * A "causal" edge is added from the current "execution context" node 
  to a newly created "causal context" node when a "cause" event is 
  received. An additional "linked by" cross-edge is added to the 
  "linking context" node with the corresponding link context value.

  * An "execution" edge is added into the newly created "execution context" 
  node from the "causal context" node with the corresponding causal context 
  value.

**TODO** use these definitions to see trees for trace examples.

### Resource Use Monitoring with Traces
A common task for a developer of a web-service is to understand how 
long it took to service a user request as well as how much time was 
spent in various sub-tasks of the processing -- in synchronous JavaScript 
code or waiting in various asynchronous queues. The first question can 
be easily answered by recording the time when HTTP request is received 
and when the response end is written (as provided by many frameworks 
today). However, to answer the second question we need to know how much 
time the callback executed in response to the HTTP event + the time of 
all asynchronous callbacks it causes. The time in the synchronous JS 
code is the total time minus this sum while the time spent blocked in 
asynchronous queues is simply the sum of this time.

Computing the total time spent in callbacks that are relevant to a single HTTP 
request while ignoring the time spent in other callbacks requires tracking the 
`causal` relation. Conceptually, we can identify a root node in the 
`asynchronous call graph` that we want to compute the inclusive execution time 
for, in our case the HTTP callback handler, and traverse all of the 
`causal context` edge -> `execution context` edge to reach a child execution 
node, summing up the times for each of the child nodes as we go (contained in 
the _Asynchronous Operation Metadata_ defined below). The resulting value is 
the total blocking execution time spent handling the HTTP request. 

**TODO** show a sample of code + async graph with multiple simultaneous 
http handlers and highlight the 1 we are looking at.

### Long Call-Stacks from Graphs
Another common task is constructing _long call stacks_. These call stacks 
connect the lexical call stacks that surround it, but were torn due to 
asynchronous execution, into a simple linear structure. To construct a 
long call stack from a set of lexical call-stacks for a given callback 
execution we need to know which of them contain variables/values that were 
live, and potentially relevant, when the callback was created.

Using the `asynchronous call graph` definitions we can construct long call 
stacks using the _causal_ -> _linked-by_ ->_link_ parent path in the graph. 
The bottom of the call-stack can be extracted from the current call stack 
up to the frame that is a `host` asynchronous API as usual. At this point we 
then look at the _causal_ parent and follow the _linked_by_ parent to find 
the link node which is the point in execution when this asynchronous call 
with the scope where the callback was linked. From here if we utilize 
additional _Asynchronous Operation Metadata_ (defined below) containing 
the line number & call stack at the time of the link operation we can get 
the next set of frames to stitch together to build the long call-stack. 
If this process is continued we will eventually reach the `root` context 
and the top of the desired long call-stack.

**TODO** add an example with sample code etc.

## Asynchronous Operation Metadata
In the previous sections we focused solely on tracking and emitting 
information on the structure of the asynchronous call graph. However, most 
applications, including our samples above, are interested in more than just the raw structure of this graph. While we cannot, and would not want to, identify 
all possible data that could be needed and write it out to our log we can 
(1) select core of commonly useful information to include and (2) add a timestamp 
that is shared with user logging code to allow the correlation of custom user 
log data with the asynchronous event data we write.

In our definitions all events are emitted with a timestamp generated by 
`generateNextTime`. To allow correlation between our emitted events and any 
user logging we expose this method to user code so they can include correlated 
timestamps in their logging. 

The other core metadata we track split it into two classes `standard` and 
`detailed`. The `standard` data is intended to include information that is 
nearly universally useful and low cost to gather while the `detailed` class 
is for less universaly relevant data or data that is expensive to capture.
 * Standard:
   - Source/Line info for applicable events.
   - **TODO** other info?
 * Detailed:
   - Callstack info the applicable events.
   - **TODO** other info?

## Enriched Terminology
The definitions in the _Terminology_ section provide basic asynchronous 
lifecycle events but do not capture many important features including, 
canceled events or failed rejections and, in cases of asynchronous events that 
depend on environmental interaction, what external events may be relevant.

To support scenarios that require this type of information we extend the vocabulary 
of events recorded in the asynchronous execution trace with the following hooks:

```
cancel(ctxf) {
    emit("cancel", ctxf.linkCtx, generateNextTime());
}

externalCause(ctxf, data) {
    emit("externalCause", ctxf.causeCtx, generateNextTime(), data);
}

failed(ctxf, reason) {
    emit("fail", reason, generateNextTime());
}

rejected(ctxf, reason, isException) {
    ctxf.rejection = currentExecutingContext;
    emit("rejected", reason, isException, generateNextTime());
}

unhandledReject(ctxf) {
    emit("rejected", ctxf.rejection, generateNextTime());
}
```

A `cancel` event is emitted when a cancellable callback, such as one 
registered with SetInterval is explicitly canceled, or when a listener such 
as on a file stream is implicitly canceled via channel termination or GC 
collection. The `cancel` event notifies us that we will never observe 
another event related to the `linkCtx` of the associated callback.

An `externalCause` event is emitted as part of a handling a callback that 
depends on external inputs, in addition to internal execution, to be caused. 
Examples include File and Network IO callbacks that need to be both `caused` 
by registering them **and** by external data arriving to trigger their 
execution. These entries provide additional context on this external data, 
included in the `data` component of the message.

A `failed` event is emitted when a callback throws an uncaught exception 
during its execution which results in an unhandled exception.

A `rejected` event is emitted when an [asynchronously executed]? promise 
rejects and includes if the rejection was the result of an exception or 
explicit reject.

An `unhandled rejection` event is emitted when an [asynchronously executed]? 
promise rejects and is not handled within a turn of the event loop as per Node [semantics](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_unhandledrejection).

**TODO** I think promise handling described here will miss something like a 
naked `Promise.reject("nothing")` call which is an unhandled rejection but 
just doesn't involve any asynchronous behavior. So, we may want to include 
synchronous promise creation/execution somehow if this is important to us. 
I think this just gets kicked back to sequential execution analysis but 
may be worth discussing.

Using the these definitions we can define the following states of an 
asynchronous execution:
 * A (sub)tree is in `active asynchronous execution` when there exists a child 
 node, link or causal, that has not completed.
 * A (sub)tree has `retired asynchronous execution` when all child nodes, 
 link of causal, are in the completed state.

## 5. Use Cases
Use cases for Async Context can be broken into two categories, **post-mortem** and
**online**.  

### Post-Mortem Use Cases** 
**Post-Mortem Use Cases** are program analysis tasks that happen after a
program has completed execution. They require reconstruction of an Async Call 
Graph up to some point in time, and is achievable via an accurate event stream 
that describes all state transitions of nodes & edges in the Async Call Graph.

#### Execution Timing Analysis
**Execution Timing Analysis** - A user wants to understand timing details of 
specific HTTP request. Since the HTTP request's processing consists of 
multiple Async Executions, a thorough timing analysis needs to understand each 
node in the path from the end of the request, to the start of the request, and 
for each node, specific timing details around each state transition. Such data
can tell us how long a request was blocked in an execution queue, or waiting
for some event, or actually executing.

  2.  Understand parent/child relationship in async call paths  - **TODO** add 
  text
    
  3.  Reconstruct async call tree to some point in time given an event stream 
  - **TODO** add text

### Online Use Cases
**Online Use Cases** are use cases where the Asynchronous Context needs to be
examined dynamically while a program is executing. Meeting requirements of
online use cases requires runtime and/or module support to keep an accurate
representation of the Async Call Graph, as well as APIs to navigate the graph. 
In particular, garbage collection passes must occur on retired sub-trees.       

Examples of Online Use Cases include:

#### Continuation Local Storage
Analagous to thread-local-storage, but for asynchronous continuations.  
Continuation Local Storage provides the ability to store key/value pairs 
in a storage container associated with the current Async Execution. Clients 
can lookup values for a given key, and the lookup will walk a path on the 
Async Call Grapp until a key is found, or it reaches the root. Continuation 
local storage is useful when code in some Asynchronous Execution needs to know 
values associated with some parent Asynchronous Execution. For example, APM 
vendors often need to associate code execution events with a specific
HTTP request.

#### Async exception handling
Traditional (i.e., synchronous) exception
handling is a multi-frame stack jump. Asynchronous Exception Handling 
can be described as a when a synchronous exception handler wishes to 
notify intersted observers about an exception. The set of interested 
observers can be succinctly described as observers on some path through 
the Async Call Graph. For example, one trivial strategy would be to 
traverse all linked edges from the current Async Excecution to the root, 
and see if any registered observers are present. 

#### Long Call Stacks
A **long call stack** is a list of call-stacks that span asynchronous callback 
operations. Analagous to a synchronous callstack, "Long call stacks" are 
useful for programmers to answer the question of "what was the call path to a 
specific point in program execution. For example, the  following code

```
function f1() {
  console.log(new Error().stack);
}

function f2() {
  console.log(new Error().stack);
  setTimeout(f1, 1000);
}

f2();
```

produces the following long stack trace on node version 8.6:

```
Error
